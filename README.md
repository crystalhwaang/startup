## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever had a random assortment of ingredients in your pantry and fridge that you don't know what to do with? The Food Fetch app makes it so that you can enter ingredients that you have in your household that you need to use up and the application spits out recipes that contain those ingredients. If you already have an idea of what you would like to cook, find the top recipes of that dish or similar dishes you could make. Upload photos of your dishes and share it with the rest of the Food Fetch community!
